# Ideas for Filters

What observations should we throw out? What players should we include in the fitting and analysis data?

- Exclude garbage time $win probability \not \in (0.05, 0.95)$
- Exclude late-half plays (half seconds remaining $\leq 30$)

# Ideas for Features

What are the most important features for predicting if a player will reach the ball landing location?

- Features included in data: acceleration, player location, player location relative to ball
- Timing: If the ball has been thrown or not.
- Voronai area
- Number of players on other team between them and ball

# Ideas for Response

- Keep it simple for now: start with 2-yard square around ball landing location.

# Ideas for Modeling Strategies

- Simple linear models
- GAMs
- XGBoost / Random Forest
- Neural network
